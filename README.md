Otherworld Origins

Todo:
- jsons jsons jsons
- Sprite selection (do in modpack)
- Lang (see notes)

Bugs we'll need to workaround: 
- Some layers sometimes get skipped? (ie picking human doesn't always prompt you to select variant, picking variatn doesn't always bring up the aptitude selector)

Lower prio (after release):
- Re-enable reset - need to make it interrupt current selection process before enabling.
- Inject info into Origin Selection Screen
